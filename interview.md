## Part 1

1. What were you doing in the couple of years before you heard from Onja 

    - I was finishing my high school study before I heard about Onja.
1. … At that time what was your life plan / your goals and ambitions?
    -  I liked studying so much but I know I was going to stop when I finish high school because I could not afford university. I was planning to farm with my parents and eventually will have my own. I will be doing the same thing as my parents'
1. How did you first hear about Onja (initial reachout), what were your first impressions?
    - My Dad heard it from the radio and he told me that my name was called, I was not sure. I thought maybe someone else has got the same name but then it was from my middle school so definitely me. I wasn't sure exactly why they called me. After a few weeks I received a letter from the CISCO inviting to sit for a test in Andilamena. I was not sure, my family was not sure what it is all about.
1. What was the next step.. (Cisco testing)
    - Next step, before the exam. I told my family I was going to take the exam and my Dad took me to the place where it happened. He let me stay one night with the recruitment team. My parents were worried until I got back home.
1. If you didn’t get into Onja what do you think you would be doing now?
    - I am not sure, what I would have been doing if I was not at Onja, most probably still farming. 

## Part 2

1. Camp
    - Probably the scariest of all time, because this time it was not going to happen in Andilamena but in Mahanoro where I knew none in there and was miles away from my village. A lot of discussions with parents and relatives many said `don't go` my parents were okay with me going as long as I was not going to be sent abroad. I then left Andilamena, my Mom was worried a lot during my trip as it was first time for me to travel that far too.
1. Study, first year
    - At this point they started to not worry because we were not going abroad. I was happy that I was going to still study again. I wasn't sure what we were going to study. I wasn't sure if I would be able to speak English in one year.
1. Study second years
    - Second year, excited about learning coding. I had never used computers prior to this point. We started talking about coding projects still was not sure what this thing called `coding` was going to be used for.
1. Getting into work
    - Our teachers said we were ready for internships/full time job. Unsure about the real working world. At my first I was doing a lot of things that did not cover during our training, some more advanced topics or completely new. These were the next challenges but colleagues were happy to help out, so that was a good thing because we can grow.
1. Do you think things will be different for W2+ students? How? (try to make them comfortable to speak their minds. If you could choose to be W1 ro W2 what would you choose and why?
