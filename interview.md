# Interview

## Part 1

1. What were you doing in the couple of years before you heard from Onja

    - I was finishing my high school study before I heard about Onja.
1. … At that time what was your life plan / your goals and ambitions?
    - I liked studying so much but I know I was going to stop when I finish high school because I could not afford university. I was planning to farm with my parents and eventually will have my own. I will be doing the same thing as my parents'
1. How did you first hear about Onja (initial reachout), what were your first impressions?
    - My Dad heard it from the radio and he told me that my name was called, I was not sure. I thought maybe someone else has got the same name but then it was from my middle school so definitely me. I wasn't sure exactly why they called me. After a few weeks I received a letter from the CISCO inviting to sit for a test in Andilamena. I was not sure, my family was not sure what it is all about.
1. What was the next step.. (Cisco testing)
    - Next step, before the exam. I told my family I was going to take the exam and my Dad took me to the place where it happened. He let me stay one night with the recruitment team. My parents were worried until I got back home.
1. If you didn’t get into Onja what do you think you would be doing now?
    - I am not sure, what I would have been doing if I was not at Onja, most probably still farming.

## Part 2

1. Camp
    - Probably the scariest of all time, because this time it was not going to happen in Andilamena but in Mahanoro where I knew none in there and was miles away from my village. A lot of discussions with parents and relatives many said `don't go` my parents were okay with me going as long as I was not going to be sent abroad. I then left Andilamena, my Mom was worried a lot during my trip as it was first time for me to travel that far too.
1. Study, first year
    - At this point they started to not worry because we were not going abroad. I was happy that I was going to still study again. I wasn't sure what we were going to study. I wasn't sure if I would be able to speak English in one year.
1. Study second years
    - Second year, excited about learning coding. I had never used computers prior to this point. We started talking about coding projects still was not sure what this thing called `coding` was going to be used for.
1. Getting into work
    - Our teachers said we were ready for internships/full time job. Unsure about the real working world. At my first I was doing a lot of things that did not cover during our training, some more advanced topics or completely new. These were the next challenges but colleagues were happy to help out, so that was a good thing because we can grow.
1. Do you think things will be different for W2+ students? How? (try to make them comfortable to speak their minds. If you could choose to be W1 or W2 what would you choose and why?
    - In terms of life maybe will be similar, like some or most of them will also be leaving their villages and families. In terms of study maybe things will be a little bit different in styles. I don't know what I would choose to be honest I think both are equally as good.

## Part 3: Personal growth

1. Do you see any changes in your character between then and now? If so, how has it changed?
    - I think
1. Do you see any changes in your mindset between then and now? If so, how has it changed?
Perhaps probing helping others, helping community
1. What are you doing now?
    - I am now a FE developer, something that I have never been able to imagine before joining Onja.
1. How do you feel like things have changed for you since coming to Onja?
    - Many things have changed. I can speak English a language I thought nobody was using :). I can probably start thinking about how to help others

## Part 4: Your reflections on the Onja experience

1. What do you most like about Onja?
    - There are a lot of good things, What I like the most is probably it's culture and mission. It cares a lot of it's people and it's mission is to help young malagasy underpriviledged people like me.
1. What do you most dislike about Onja?
    - I don't know
1. How were your teachers at Onja? Do any stand out?
    - Yeah, the teachers were really nice, they were the teachers that makes you want to go to school everyday. They were all stood out to me in different ways. Some were funny, some were helping even acting like mothers or big sisters, some were like parents. They were all lovely
What do you see as the big-picture impact of Onja for young people in Madagascar?
    - I think Onja will reduce the number of students that cant go to high school or university but still offering them training and actually having a good job. In the end many young people are working on the same goal to help improve others.

## Part 5: Looking forward

1. What are you most proud of about what you’ve accomplished?
    - I think we've been a proof that the model at Onja is working. And now we have now got or first next wave even not the big one yet but it's already a big step to move forward.
1. When you look at your future now, what do you see?
    - I see a big screen
(ask devs what questions they think would be good)
